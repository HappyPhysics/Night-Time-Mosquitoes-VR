### What is this repository for? ###

A Simple VR experience made with unity (Standard VR assets, Cross-Platform). 

You see beautiful natural scenery at night. 
There are animals standing and you have a horse. Nice fire. 
And then you get annoyed by robot mosquitos that you 
need to shoot down with electromagnetic waves that have the right frequency.
(GDD included).
